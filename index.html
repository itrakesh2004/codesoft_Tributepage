            <p> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born to Jainulabdeen, a boat owner and Imam, and Ashiamma, a housewife. Kalam had four brothers and a sister, all elder to him. <br>
            Kalam studied at a school in Ramanathapuram and acquired a degree in Physics from Saint Josephs College, Tiruchirappalli. In 1955, he went to the Madras Institute of Technology to pursue aerospace engineering. His dream of becoming a fighter pilot was thwarted when he missed the qualifier by a narrow margin. He was ranked ninth but only 8 positions were available with the IAF. <br>
            Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 1969. At ISRO, he was the Project Director of the satellite launch vehicle (SLV) that successfully deployed the satellite Rohini into orbit in 1980. It was Indias first SLV. <br>
            <h2>Kalam also worked to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV).</h2> <br>
            <b>He was known as the Missile Man of India for his work in the development of ballistic missile technology.</b> <br>


            <u> <b>From 1992 to 1999, Kalam was the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of the DRDO. Kalam was the Chief Project Coordinator during the Pokhran II tests.</b></u> <br>

            Abdul Kalam died of a cardiac arrest while giving a lecture at the IIM Shillong on 27 July 2015. There was widespread grief expressed at his passing away with the government of India declaring a 7-day state mourning. The governments of various other countries as well as the United Nations expressed their grief. <br>

            Abdul Kalam was a man of integrity who was known for his honesty. He left no personal wealth after his death barring a few personal possessions which included his books, laptop, etc.
